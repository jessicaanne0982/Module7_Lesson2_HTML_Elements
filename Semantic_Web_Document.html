        <h1>My Mission to make Gluten Free Delicious</h1>
        <p>About 8 years ago, I was diagnosed with a gluten allergy, and it completely turned my world upside down.  I love all things baked, but my 
            new diagnosis meant I'd have to have to find alternatives if I wanted to continue enjoying yummy baked goods. It was at that time that I 
            started my mission to bake gluten free goodies that tasted better than their "gluten-full" counterparts.

            <h2>What is a Gluten Free Diet</h2>
            <p>Being gluten free means no longer eating anything containing gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, or rye.  </p>
            <p>This includes avoiding foods such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Breads & pastries</li>
                <li>Crackers & Pretzels</li>
                <li>Breaded foods</li>
                <li>Cereals</li>
                <li>Pasta</li>
                <li>Many other hidden sources of wheat, barley, or rye and their derivitives</li>

                This is a great article from the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/gluten-free-diet/art-20048530">
                Mayo Clinic</a> explaining the different forms of gluten intolerances and just what a gluten free diet entails.

             <p>After much trial and error, I quickly learned that good gluten free baking comes down to the ingredients you use, <strong>ESPECIALLY</strong>
            the flour.  A good flour blend makes all the difference in the world when you're baking gluten free.  Over the years, I have learned which blends 
            give me the results I want and which leave me with gritty, inedible concoctions.  I also invest in highest quality ingredients possible - Madagascar vanilla,
            Ghirardelli chocolates, and only full fat butters, creams, and milks. </p>
            <aside>My 2 favorite types of flours to use are

            <h4>Baking is my love language</h4>
            <p>These days, I bake almost every weekend, whether it's for my family or surprise parties or for those simply in need of a smile.  Baking brings me joy, and  
                I just love to see the smile on people's faces when they eat one of my baked goods.</p>
            <p>Since my mission began, I've surprised many "gluten eaters" with my baked goods.  Everything that leaves my kitchen now is gluten free, and I absolutely
                love to see the look of shock on their faces when they learn they've just eaten a gluten free treat.  I often hear, "I had NO idea! That was better
                than a '<i>normal</i>' one." </p>
